<A> Sunchokes are related to sunflowers. The scientific name for the plant is Helianthus Tuberosus. They grow around six to ten feet tall. Sunchokes require regular watering but can manage some droughts. In terms of harvesting, you can harvest in the late fall or early spring. They are yellow and look quite beautiful in the sun. Sunchokes also need to be 18 inches apart and 6 inches deep in the ground to fulfill its maximum potential. They also prefer to grow around 65-90 degrees fahrenheit. They are also normally resistent to pests unlike other plants. Sunchokes must be planted when there is a full sun. </A><BR><BR>
