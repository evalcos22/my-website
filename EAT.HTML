<A> Sunchokes can be prepared in so many different ways. Sunchokes can often be sweet or crunchy depending on how they are prepared. If you were to roast the sunchokes, it would taste like chestnuts or even sweet potatoes. Sunchokes can be mashed, boiled, sauteed, or even be made into chips. You can even substitute potatoes themselves for sunchokes. The best part about the sunchoke though is the fact that you do not need to peel the skin, but can eat it all together. There are so many unique recipes that someone can make out of sunchokes which is great. It is one of the best vegetables available.
